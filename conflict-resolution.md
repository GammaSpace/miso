# Conflict Resolution Policy

## Purpose

Disagreements in groups are par for the course. But ignoring conflicts, or managing them poorly, can deeply harm individuals and our whole community.

Addressing conflict head-on is ***a way of caring for each other***.

Our policies and procedures around conduct and conflict are the tools we rely on to prevent harm and intervene early when things go wrong.

This policy aims to offer a straightforward, consistently enforced, and transparent approach to resolving conflicts and disputes. These issues could emerge in relation to our cooperative's programs, governance, or the actions of its members and directors.

## Who does this policy apply to?

All members and directors must comply with this Conflict Resolution Policy and related by-laws and policies as a condition of membership or board service. Failure to cooperate may result in membership review.

## What policy should be used?

| Who Can File | Type of Complaint | Policy Reference | Additional Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Members, directors | Informal complaints of unacceptable behaviour | Code of Conduct |  |
| Members, directors | An interpersonal problem or dispute that is not a violation of the Code of Conduct | This policy |  |
| Members, directors, public | Conflict of interest | Conflict of Interest Policy | Addressed alongside the organization's specific policy |

## Guiding principles

- Our values apply in every interaction:  
  - Video Games: A Medium For Change: A practice that reflects our values  
  - Collective Care & Support: Valuing our health and wellbeing  
  - Personal & Collective Accountability: Critical engagement with values  
  - Creative Empowerment: Support individual agency in creation  
  - Challenging Systemic Norms: Striving for equity in our industry

- This process doesn’t solely address interpersonal or systemic issues. These things are linked – we address the systemic through the interpersonal.  
- Our skills and resources will be developed and used to resolve conflicts in a way that is based on our principles of anti-oppression whenever possible.  
- All parties to a complaint will *actively participate* and strive to achieve a *collaborative* outcome at the earliest possible stage of the process.  
- Information about a complaint will only be given to parties directly involved, Conflict Resolution Committee members, and others on a need-to-know basis as determined by the committee.  
- The parties will be provided with clear and understandable reasons for complaint decisions. All parties will be provided with updates during the review process.  
- Complaints will be dealt with promptly and resolved as quickly as possible.  
- Review of complaints will be fair, impartial, and respectful, allowing all parties to have their perspectives heard.  
- The review of complaints will be thorough and as detailed as possible based on the information provided by the parties.  
- The process will be accessible and clearly communicated to members.

This process is our coop’s responsibility. Members have the right to request a mediator if required.

## Definitions

- **Conflict** and **dispute** are ongoing experiences of tension and misunderstandings, often leading to interpersonal discord. These terms are used interchangeably.  
- The **Conflict Resolution Committee** is a standing committee to which unresolved formal complaints are sent for review and recommendations.   
- A **complainant** is the individual lodging a complaint against another related individual, policy, or practice.  
- The **Internal Advisor** is the member-appointed mediator who facilitates the conflict resolution process. They work to achieve a satisfactory solution by acting as an intermediary and convening authority. The membership appoints one or more Internal Advisors annually from the membership, or general membership based on their training, experience, and neutrality.  
  - Membership-appointed mediator  
  - Facilitates **formal** conflict resolution process

  - Can engage external mediators if needed  
- Member liaison(s)  
  - Volunteer position  
  - First contact for member complaints

## Responsibility for implementation

This policy acknowledges and respects the governance structure of Gamma Space, which states that the Board of Directors is responsible for matters related to board policy, decisions, activities, and governance, while operational decisions are made collectively by the membership according to our bylaws.

# Conflict Resolution Procedures

We do our best to resolve conflicts at the lowest possible escalation step (direct resolution), but agree to escalate conflicts (to assisted resolution) if they are not resolved.

### Reflection

1. Set aside some time to think through what happened. What was the other person's behaviour? How did it affect you? *Distinguish other people's **actions** from your **feelings** about them.*   
2. Consider what uncertainties or misunderstandings may have occurred.  
3. Distinguish disagreement from personal hostility. Disagreement and dissent are part of healthy discussion. Hostility is not.  
4. Use your personal support system (friends, family, therapist, etc.) to work through and clarify your perspective.  
5. Ask yourself what part you played, how you could have behaved differently, and what your needs are.

## Direct resolution

A *direct resolution* process occurs when individuals communicate their concerns and work together to resolve disputes without filing an informal or formal complaint.

### Have a conversation

When there is a disagreement, the involved people should first **communicate with each other** about their concerns. Both people should refer to the Code of Conduct to guide them on how to conduct themselves in resolving the dispute.

1. Choose a time and place to meet that is private and agreeable to both.  
2. Allow a reasonable amount of time.  
3. The point of the meeting is not to determine who is right or wrong, but rather to reach **a mutual understanding**. Achieving this requires patience and a willingness to listen to the other person's perspective without immediately dismissing it as incorrect. *Share ideas, ask clarifying questions, and respond to each other's ideas.*  
4. Express your thoughts and feelings directly and without belittling or dismissing the other person's perspective. This can be achieved by using "I" statements and [active listening](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/coaching-others-use-active-listening-skills/) techniques.  
5. Communicate your **wants** and **needs** and make **offers** and **requests**.  
6. During the conversation, try your best to learn how to avoid miscommunication and misunderstandings in the future. Ask questions like, "If what I/you said or did came across that way, what can we do to prevent this from happening in the future?"  
7. Keep a written record of the resolution of this conversation, agreed to by both parties.

Escalating Bandwidth Whenever a misunderstanding or conflict arises, **escalate the bandwidth of the channel**. If you’re on Slack asynchronous text, move to Slack synchronous text at a planned time. From synchronous chat to an audio Huddle, audio to video. *Credit: [Joshua Vial](https://joshuavial.com/loomio-conflict/)*

## Assisted resolution

### Informal complaints

If talking things out doesn't work, you can ask a responsible contact person for help in writing. Mention that you're making an *informal complaint* and seeking assistance.

#### Responsible contact people

| Complainant | First Contact |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Member of the organization** | Member liaison\- or \- Conflict Resolution Committee if the complaint is about a board member\- or \- Individual Conflict Resolution Committee member if the complaint is about a committee member |
| **Board member** | Internal Advisor |

When someone makes an informal complaint, the responsible contact person (RCP) will ask if they have tried to resolve the issue themselves and will talk to the Internal Advisor if necessary. Within two weeks of the complaint being made, they will work to settle the matter through the informal complaint resolution process. If one party refuses participation, a **formal complaint** may be lodged.

#### Procedure

If the chosen process results in an acceptable informal outcome for both parties, the matter will be considered resolved.

### Formal complaints

If informal resolution efforts do not result in an acceptable outcome within a reasonable timeframe or to the satisfaction of the complainant, they may file a *formal complaint* in writing.

The written complaint must include:

1. The complainant’s name  
2. The respondent's name  
3. Detailed information about what the issue is, what has taken place, where, and when  
4. Details of all prior efforts to achieve a resolution  
5. The specific outcome(s) the complainant is seeking

It should be submitted to the appropriate RCP.

*Seeking external advice and expertise to aid this process is recommended.*

#### Responsible contact people

| Complainant Type | First Contact |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Members** | Member liaison or Internal Advisor |
| **Directors** | Internal Advisor |
| **Public** | Member liaison |

The Internal Advisor will:

1. Acknowledge receipt within one week  
2. Review the complaint for completeness  
3. Assess relevant bylaws and policies  
4. Facilitate direct resolution if possible  
5. If needed, engage the Conflict Resolution Committee

Any resolution must be documented in writing and signed by all parties. The agreement should:

* Align with cooperative values  
* Be realistic and sustainable  
* Not compromise the organization  
* Be within the scope of the parties' roles

#### Updating the complainant

Within one week of complaint receipt, the Internal Advisor will inform the complainant that they have carried out an initial review of their complaint, provide the complainant with a copy of this policy, review the direct resolution process, and communicate additional information required, including:

1. If applicable, referral of the complaint to a separate process  
2. Available informal or assisted resolution options  
3. That processes in relation to this policy cannot result in an award of damages or compensation to the complainant, respondent, or anyone else  
4. That processes in relation to this policy may or may not result in disciplinary measures against the respondent  
5. That the respondent will receive a copy of the complaint (with the complainant’s name) if it is not resolved through informal resolution mechanisms

#### Procedure

##### Notice to respondent

*Offer of direct resolution* The Internal Advisor will send the respondent a written complaint disclosure once the requirements have been met and they have ensured a direct resolution process is not jeopardized.

1. A copy of the complaint  
2. Supporting materials, if any  
3. An assessment of organizational policies and/or codes of practice that may be engaged  
4. A copy of this policy  
5. A request for a response within two weeks  
6. An offer to facilitate direct resolution  
7. If the Respondent does not reply within one week, the Internal Advisor will notify the RCP, who will then decide a course of action with the information provided to date. They may consult with the Conflict Resolution Committee Committee, as needed.

##### Initial response to the complainant

*Offer of direct resolution* Once the respondent replies, the Internal Advisor will send the following to the complainant:

1. A copy of the response  
2. Supporting materials, if any  
3. An assessment of organizational policies and/or codes of practice that may be engaged  
4. An offer to facilitate a direct resolution

If both parties accept the offer of direct resolution, the Internal Advisor will arrange to facilitate the process within one week. This may include such processes as informal meetings, negotiation, facilitated meetings or shuttle or in-person mediation. The Internal Advisor may engage an external mediator if required.

#### Reaching an agreement

Any resolution of a complaint that is agreed upon through direct negotiation must be documented in writing and signed by both the complainant and respondent. These "Minutes of Settlement" will be kept confidential and only shared with the Internal Advisor, Board, legal counsel, or other parties who need to know to fulfill their organizational duties.

Considerations when agreeing should include:

1. Is the agreement within the scope of the parties’ decision-making powers in relation to their organizational role?  
2. Is the agreement realistic and durable?  
3. Does the agreement in any way compromise the organization?  
4. Are there elements of the agreement that impact the organization's operations, policies, reputation, external relationships or public perceptions?  
5. Does it align with our Values?

#### If no agreement is reached

If direct resolution fails, the Internal Advisor will forward all documentation to the Conflict Resolution Committee for review. The Committee may seek external advice and decide on a course of action, which may include:

1. Temporary modification of member participation in specific activities or committees to reduce conflict   
2. Facilitated dialogue sessions  with each party to develop conflict management strategies  
3. Recommendation of specific training or education for involved parties   
4. Implementation of organizational practice and policy changes to prevent similar conflicts  
5. Assignment of mentors or support people from the membership Creation of clear agreements about future interactions and expectations  
6. Referral to the Board for review if the conflict significantly impacts cooperative operations  
7. Referral to external mediation services  
8. In severe cases, initiation of membership review process as outlined in bylaws  
9. If applicable, referral to authorities (e.g., Human Rights Tribunal or [Canadian Human Rights Commission](https://www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca/eng)) for discrimination or harassment cases

Any actions taken should:

* Prioritize the coop’s continued functioning  
* Maintain accessibility and inclusivity  
* Support involved parties in continuing their membership when possible  
* Address systemic or structural issues that may have contributed to the conflict  
* Align with cooperative values and principles
