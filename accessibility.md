### Accessibility

We strive to create a space that is accommodating and easy-to-use for people who use assistive devices.

The main entrance to the building features an automated door that opens by pushing a button. However, the button only operates the door during business hours (10 a.m. to 6 p.m.). If you arrive after 6 p.m., and do not need assistance with the door, dial _800_ on the keypad and someone will buzz you in.

If you need assistance opening the door, or cannot reach the directory/buzz-in system, please call or text (416) 879-8942 (Henry's mobile) or call (416) 848-3702 (office landline) and someone will be happy to meet you.

If you require ASL interpretation or any other assistance in order to attend and enjoy this event, please contact us and we will be happy to help.

Access to our space is through a door just inside the entrance and there are no stairs to ascend. Unfortunately, the latch for the door was removed by the owner of the building in 2016, and we are unable to leave the suite door propped open.

The washroom is all-gender, and fully wheelchair accessible.

We welcome and invite your feedback about how to make the space easier for you to use. Contact us in person, via phone or email with your suggestions or questions.
