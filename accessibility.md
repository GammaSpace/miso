### Accessibility

We strive to create a space that is accommodating and easy-to-use for people who use assistive devices.

#### Building Access

The main entrance to the building features two double doors. However, they are not powered. The doors push inward to open. An elevator is available in the lobby. All interior spaces, including ours, are barrier- and step-free.

If you're attending a public event, the door will likely be propped after 6 p.m. or a volunteer will be stationed there. If this is not the case, or you you need additional assistance opening the door, please call or text (416) 879-8942 and someone will be happy to meet you.

#### Washroom

The washrooms are all-gender, and fully wheelchair accessible. 

#### Interpretive Assistance

If you require ASL interpretation or any other interpretive assistance, please contact us and we will do our very best to help.

We welcome and invite your feedback about how to make the space easier for you to use. Contact us in person, via phone or email with your suggestions or questions.
