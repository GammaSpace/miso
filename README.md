Gamma Space Policies
====

Gamma Space (formerly Bento Miso) makes its code of conduct, inclusiveness statement and other policies and templates available for any community to use or adapt. These policies can be important tools for building healthy communities, but require a commitment to uphold and maintain in order to be effective.

We recommend you use these policies as a jumping-off point; take time to refine them to fit your group; and ensure your staff, members and board provide input.
